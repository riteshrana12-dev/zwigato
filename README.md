🛵 ZWIGATO – Food Delivery UI Prototype
ZWIGATO is a dynamic frontend prototype for a food delivery platform inspired by apps like Zomato and Swiggy. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it showcases interactive UI components, animated transitions, and mock data-driven rendering—all designed for portfolio impact and real-world scalability.
🔧 Features Implemented
- Dynamic Filter UI: Filter options for cuisine and delivery type are rendered via JavaScript using structured mock data.
- Restaurant & Delivery Cards: Cards are generated dynamically from JSON and dummy data files, with scroll-triggered animations and lazy loading.
- Responsive Layout: Tailwind-inspired styling ensures clean presentation across devices.
- Footer Section: Includes branding and placeholder links for future expansion.
- Login & Signup Forms: UI placeholders styled with animation, ready for backend integration.
